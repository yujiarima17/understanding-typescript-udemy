typescript type system only helps during development, so its before the code gets compiled
----
difference between typescript x javascript - javascript uses "dynamic types" so its resolved at runtime, and
typescript uses "static types" so its resolved during development
enum is efficient when we need to use "human" understanding for our variables
types are useful when we use union types on our objects or function body parameters
